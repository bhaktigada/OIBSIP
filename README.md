<b>Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship Projects<b>
Welcome to the Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship Projects (OIBSIP) repository! This repository contains the code and resources for the three exciting data science tasks completed during the internship. Each task focuses on different aspects of data science and machine learning. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute to the projects.

<b>Task 1: Iris Flower Classification<b>
In this task, we tackled the challenge of classifying iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The Scikit-learn library provides a dataset for iris flower classification, which has been used to train a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying iris species based on their measurements.

<b>Task 2: Unemployment Rate Analysis<b>
Task 2 involved the analysis of the unemployment rate, particularly focusing on the sharp increase during the Covid-19 pandemic. By studying the unemployment rate data and its correlation with various factors, we gained insights into the impact of the pandemic on the job market.

<b>Task 3: Car Price Prediction<b>
In Task 3, we delved into car price prediction. Considering factors such as brand reputation, car features, horsepower, and mileage, we built a machine learning model capable of predicting the price of a car. This project showcases the application of machine learning in the automobile industry.
